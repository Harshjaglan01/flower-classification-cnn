# Automated Flower Identification Using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project aims to develop a model for identifying five different flower species (rose, tulip, sunflower, dandelion, daisy) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Description

* The dataset consists of 5,000 images (1,000 images per class) collected from various online sources.
* The model achieved an accuracy of 98.58% on the test set.

## Usage

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* TensorFlow: For making Neural Networks
* numpy: For numerical computing and array operations.
* pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
* matplotlib: For creating visualizations such as line plots, bar plots, and histograms.
* seaborn: For advanced data visualization and creating statistically-informed graphics.
* scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model training.


To run the project:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook flower_classification.ipynb`
